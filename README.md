# Culinary Delights App

This project is a simple cooking/recipe web app built with **Next.js** and **Contentful** as the CMS. Below you'll find important context, arguments for technical decisions, and usage instructions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Context

- **Next.js**: Used as the main React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Contentful**: Used as the headless CMS to manage all content (sections, posts, images, etc.).
- **GraphQL**: All Contentful data is fetched using GraphQL queries for flexibility and efficiency.
- **Plain CSS (BEM Methodology)**: Styling is done with plain CSS using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for clarity and maintainability. No CSS-in-JS, preprocessors, or utility frameworks are used, as the app only has two main sections and simplicity was preferred.

## üì¶ Contentful Limitations & Decisions

- **Rich Text & Markdown**: Contentful supports rich text features like color, bold, and other formatting via Markdown. For this project, I decided to **omit Markdown rendering** and display only plain text for simplicity and consistency.
- **GraphQL API**: All data is fetched from Contentful using its GraphQL API, which allows for precise and efficient queries.

## üöÄ Running the App

To start the development server, simply run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## üí° Design & Methodology

- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: All CSS classes follow the BEM convention for better readability and scalability.
- **No CSS Preprocessor**: Chose plain CSS for simplicity, as the project only contains two main sections.
- **No Styled Components**: Avoided CSS-in-JS to keep the stack minimal and the build fast.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
